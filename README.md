# Orchestra

The framework behind [Solista](https://github.com/gspataro/Solista).

Orchestra is a lightweight, flexible static site building engine designed to process content, resolve relationships, and generate static output through a modular pipeline.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Pipeline-based architecture
- 🧠 Content querying and relationships
- 📄 Schema-driven page generation
- ⚡ Fast builds with caching
- 🧪 Rehearsal mode for local preview

## 📦 Installation

`composer require gspataro/orchestra`

## 🚀 Usage

Orchestra is designed to be used through **Solista**, which provides:

- a default project structure
- CLI commands
- a ready-to-use theme

If you want full control, you can integrate Orchestra directly into your own application.

## 🧪 Rehearsal mode

Rehearsal is a lightweight development server that allows you to preview your site without performing a full build.

- No files are written to disk
- Pages are generated on demand
- Ideal for content editing and rapid iteration

## ⚡ Caching

Orchestra uses an internal caching system to optimize build performance.

- Content parsing is cached
- Rebuilds are incremental where possible
- Theme changes do not invalidate content cache

## 🧩 Extensibility

Orchestra is built around a modular architecture:

- Custom runtimes
- Custom generators
- Custom content sources

This allows you to adapt the engine to different use cases beyond traditional static sites.

## 🤝 Third-party packages

Orchestra relies on the following open-source packages:

- [twig/twig](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/)
- [league/commonmark](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/)
- [symfony/yaml](https://github.com/symfony/yaml)
